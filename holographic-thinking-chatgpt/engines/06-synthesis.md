# Engine 6: Synthesis Engine

**Priority**: FINAL (runs last before Learning)  
**Execution**: Integrates all parallel results into coherent answer  
**Role**: Collapse parallel dimensions into actionable recommendation  
**Output**: Clear answer, action plan, confidence levels, caveats

---

## Purpose

All the other engines produce insights. This engine integrates them into one coherent, actionable answer that you can actually use.

It's the difference between analysis and decision.

---

## What Synthesis Does

1. **Integrates** all engine outputs
2. **Resolves** conflicts between perspectives
3. **Weights** insights by evidence quality
4. **Prioritizes** actions by impact
5. **Communicates** clearly and concisely
6. **Acknowledges** uncertainty honestly
7. **Provides** a decision point

---

## The Integration Process

### Step 1: Extract Key Insights from Each Engine

```
FROM ORACLE (6 perspectives):
- Insight 1 (Perspective A, 85% confidence)
- Insight 2 (Perspective B, 70% confidence)
- Insight 3 (Perspective C, 60% confidence)
[Etc.]

FROM MECHANICAL:
- Insight 1 (Component X is critical)
- Insight 2 (SPOF exists at Y)
- Insight 3 (Bottleneck at Z)

FROM TRIBUNAL:
- Weighted verdict: [Verdict]
- Confidence: X%
- Key disagreements: [What conflicted?]

FROM EDGE CASES:
- Critical risk 1: [Scenario]
- Critical risk 2: [Scenario]
- Mitigation strategy: [Plan]

FROM MULTISOURCE:
- Domain 1 insight: [Pattern]
- Domain 2 insight: [Pattern]
- Novel connection: [Surprise]

FROM MEMORY:
- Similar past episode: [Relevant context]
- Pattern from learning: [What we learned before]

FROM AFFECT:
- Emotional factors: [What matters emotionally?]
- Motivation: [What actually drives this?]
```

---

### Step 2: Identify Conflicts

```
ORACLE says: "Perspective A seems best"
TRIBUNAL says: "But evidence doesn't strongly support it"
EDGE CASES says: "And this scenario would break it"

RESOLUTION:
- Where do they conflict?
- Is it a fact conflict or value conflict?
- Who has better evidence?
- What needs to change the verdict?
```

---

### Step 3: Weight by Evidence Quality

```
INSIGHT from Oracle perspective A:
- Evidence quality: Medium
- Confidence of source: 85%
- Corroboration: Supported by Mechanical analysis
→ WEIGHT: High (worth including)

INSIGHT from Oracle perspective B:
- Evidence quality: Low
- Confidence of source: 50%
- Corroboration: Contradicted by Tribunal
→ WEIGHT: Low (note but don't emphasize)

[Weight all insights similarly]
```

---

### Step 4: Build the Integrated Answer

```
THE CORE CLAIM:
[Based on weighted evidence, what's the answer?]

Supporting Evidence:
1. [From Tribunal - strongest evidence]
2. [From Mechanical - system understanding]
3. [From Oracle - multiple perspectives agree]
4. [From Multisource - cross-domain support]

Caveats:
1. [From Edge Cases - risks that could change this]
2. [From Mechanical - constraints that limit options]
3. [From Affect - emotional factors to consider]
4. [From Memory - past failures to learn from]
```

---

## Creating the Action Plan

### Identify Next Steps

```
What actually needs to happen?

STEP 1: [Decision/Action with highest priority]
- Why: [Evidence-based reasoning]
- How: [Specific approach]
- Resources: [What's needed?]
- Timeline: [When to do this?]
- Success metric: [How to know if it worked?]

STEP 2: [Second priority]
- Why: [Evidence-based reasoning]
- How: [Specific approach]
- Resources: [What's needed?]
- Timeline: [When to do this?]
- Success metric: [How to know if it worked?]

[Continue for 3-7 key steps]
```

---

### Add Mitigations for Edge Cases

```
IF [critical risk happens]:
→ Do [mitigation]
→ Timeline: [How quickly?]
→ Responsibility: [Who handles?]
→ Backup plan: [If first mitigation fails?]

[For each critical edge case]
```

---

### Add Contingency Decisions

```
DECISION POINT 1:
At [time/milestone], we'll evaluate if [condition].
- If YES: [Do this]
- If NO: [Do this instead]
- Review frequency: [How often to check?]

DECISION POINT 2:
At [time/milestone], we'll evaluate if [condition].
- If YES: [Do this]
- If NO: [Do this instead]

[Build in review points, not one-and-done]
```

---

## Confidence Calibration

### Different Levels of Confidence

```
90%+ Confidence: Very high
- Multiple strong evidence sources
- Low probability of error
- Can act decisively
Example: "You should invest in your education" (near-universal)

70-89% Confidence: High
- Strong evidence sources
- Some uncertainty remains
- Reasonable to commit, but monitor
Example: "You should take this job" (most career decisions)

50-69% Confidence: Moderate
- Evidence is mixed
- Legitimate disagreement
- Decision depends on values/risk tolerance
Example: "You might want to try this approach"

30-49% Confidence: Low
- Not enough evidence either way
- Genuinely uncertain
- Needs more information or time
Example: "It's unclear if this will work"

Below 30%: Very low
- Insufficient basis for decision
- Should gather more information
- Or decide based on other factors (values, intuition)
```

## Example: Career Decision Synthesis

```
SYNTHESIS: Should you take the job and move?

CORE ANSWER:
"Yes, if three conditions are met:
1. Your kids are 12+ (relational impact is lower)
2. Your spouse genuinely supports it (not just accepting)
3. You have a 2-year exit plan (reversibility)"

OVERALL CONFIDENCE: 72%

KEY EVIDENCE FOR THIS ANSWER:
1. Oracle: Multiple perspectives support it (esp. career growth angle)
2. Tribunal: Evidence weighs toward yes (70% weighted verdict)
3. Mechanical: System is viable if support is in place
4. Multisource: Evolution principle suggests adaptation is healthy
5. Memory: Similar career moves have worked well for others

KEY EVIDENCE AGAINST:
1. Edge Cases: Risk to family is significant if conditions aren't right
2. Mechanical: Missing family is a real cost (not just opportunity cost)
3. Affect: Emotional factors create real resistance (valid data)
4. Psychology: Identity shift is harder than it seems

CONDITIONAL ELEMENTS:
- IF kids are under 12: Recommendation changes to "Stay"
- IF spouse is reluctant: Recommendation changes to "Explore alternatives"
- IF job is unstable: Recommendation changes to "Be very careful"

ACTION PLAN:

1. DECISION CONVERSATION (This week)
   - Have honest talk with spouse
   - Surface and resolve doubts
   - Success metric: Both feel heard and aligned
   
2. THOROUGH JOB VETTING (2 weeks)
   - Talk to 5 current employees
   - Research culture and turnover
   - Clarify role and expectations
   - Success metric: Know what you're getting into
   
3. FINANCIAL PLANNING (2 weeks)
   - Calculate true financial impact (salary minus moving, COL)
   - Build emergency fund for contingencies
   - Plan visit schedule and costs
   - Success metric: Know you can afford the decision
   
4. ACCEPT OFFER (If all above check out)
   - Negotiate start date (adequate prep time)
   - Discuss flexibility for family emergencies
   - Clarify trial period expectations
   - Success metric: Clarity on both sides
   
5. PRE-MOVE PREPARATION (2-3 months)
   - Find community in new city (groups, activities)
   - Establish support system (therapist, friends)
   - Visit and get familiar
   - Success metric: Reduced anxiety about move
   
6. MOVE AND ADJUST (0-6 months)
   - Take 1st 3 months seriously (adaptation period)
   - Regular family contact (video calls daily, visits monthly)
   - Check in with self: "Is this working?"
   - Success metric: Family is stable, you're adapting

7. 6-MONTH EVALUATION
   - Honest assessment: Is the job/city what you expected?
   - Family health: Are they handling it?
   - Your satisfaction: Are you happy?
   - Success metric: Clear picture of whether this is working
   
8. 2-YEAR DECISION POINT (Commitment milestone)
   - Major evaluation: Is this still worth it?
   - Family impact: Permanently positive or problematic?
   - Career impact: Is the growth happening?
   - Decision: Stay, leave, or adjust?
   - Success metric: Active choice, not default continuation

MITIGATIONS FOR EDGE CASES:

Risk: Family falls apart
Mitigation: Monthly therapy (proactive, not reactive)
Backup: Return move if not working by 1 year

Risk: New job disappoints
Mitigation: Trial period exit clause (negotiate upfront)
Backup: Have 6-month financial runway to transition

Risk: You're unhappy in new city
Mitigation: Intentional community building (not optional)
Backup: Extended family visits, or remote work negotiation

CAVEATS:

1. Kids' Age is Critical
   If kids are under 12, recommendation changes significantly
   This is the highest-impact variable
   
2. Spouse Agreement is Gatekeeping
   If spouse doesn't genuinely support it, plan will fail
   Their wellbeing is not optional
   
3. Family Crisis Probability is Real
   30% chance something happens in 2-3 years
   Have exit plan ready before crisis hits
   
4. Happiness is Unpredictable
   You can't fully predict if you'll like the city
   Plan for this uncertainty (quick exit if needed)
   
5. Regret is Common
   40% of people who move regret it
   Don't second-guess constantly (give it 2 years)
   But also don't ignore real problems
   
WHAT COULD CHANGE THIS VERDICT:

- If kids are under 12 → "Stay" instead of "Go"
- If spouse is reluctant → "Explore alternatives" instead
- If job is unstable → "Be very careful" instead
- If you can't afford move → "Not recommended" instead
- If you have aging parents → "More risky" instead

CONFIDENCE EXPLANATION:

72% confidence means:
- We have good evidence this could work
- But legitimate uncertainties remain
- Especially about family dynamics and personal happiness
- You have an exit plan if it doesn't work
- Decision is reversible within 2 years

This is high enough to recommend action, but honest about unknowns.

## Integration with Other Engines

All other engines feed into Synthesis:
- **Oracle** → Perspectives to integrate
- **Mechanical** → System constraints
- **Tribunal** → Evidence-weighted verdict
- **Edge Cases** → Risks to address
- **Multisource** → Cross-domain wisdom
- **Memory** → Contextual knowledge
- **Affect** → Emotional factors

Synthesis is the **decision point**. Everything else is exploration.

---

## Key Principle

**Synthesis is not about finding the "right answer."**

It's about:
1. Showing your reasoning transparently
2. Acknowledging uncertainty honestly
3. Providing a clear decision point
4. Building in reversibility
5. Planning for when things don't go as expected

**Good synthesis makes you confident enough to act, while aware enough to adapt.**
