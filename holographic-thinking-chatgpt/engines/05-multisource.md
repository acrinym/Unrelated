# Engine 5: Multisource Inquiry

**Priority**: ENRICHMENT (runs after Oracle)  
**Execution**: Cross-domain knowledge synthesis  
**Role**: Import wisdom and patterns from unrelated fields  
**Output**: Interdisciplinary insights, applicable patterns, surprising connections

## Purpose

The best ideas often come from outside your domain. A pattern from biology might solve a business problem. Game theory might explain a relationship conflict. History might predict the future.

This engine asks: "What can we learn from fields that have nothing to do with this?"

## How to Extract Cross-Domain Insights

### Step 1: Identify Relevant Domains

For your question, which domains might have relevant patterns?

```
QUESTION: Should I change careers?

Potentially relevant domains:
✓ Biology (adaptation, evolution)
✓ Psychology (motivation, identity)
✓ Economics (opportunity cost, risk/reward)
✓ History (career changes, precedent)
✓ Game theory (competition, positioning)
✓ Philosophy (meaning, values)
```

---

### Step 2: Extract Pattern from Each Domain

```
BIOLOGY PERSPECTIVE:
Pattern: Evolution requires mutation and selection
Application: Career change is a mutation. Selection will determine if it succeeds.
Insight: Don't fear the uncertainty; adaptation requires risk.
Applicable? YES

PSYCHOLOGY PERSPECTIVE:
Pattern: Identity is central to motivation
Application: Career change affects identity ("I was a [role]")
Insight: Emotional resistance is expected; identity shift is part of the process.
Applicable? YES

ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE:
Pattern: Opportunity cost is what you give up to gain something
Application: Career change costs time, money, and certainty
Insight: Calculate what you're giving up, not just what you're gaining.
Applicable? YES
```

---

### Step 3: Generate Novel Insights

```
SURPRISING CONNECTIONS:

Biology + Psychology:
- Evolution requires variation and selection
- Identity affects what variations you try
→ INSIGHT: Your psychological resistance might prevent the right mutation

Economics + History:
- Opportunity cost is highest when you have options
- Career changes are easier when desperate
→ INSIGHT: Paradox: You're more likely to change when it hurts least, but that's when you need it least

Game Theory + Psychology:
- In games, predictability is a disadvantage
- Career moves are often predictable (everyone moves at same career stage)
→ INSIGHT: Zig when others zag? Unique career paths might be more valuable
```

## Example: Multisource Analysis on Career Change

```
DOMAIN 1: BIOLOGY
Pattern: "Evolution happens at the edge of chaos"
Application: Career changes work best with some stability but not too much
Insight: Complete safety prevents growth; complete chaos prevents learning
→ Mitigation: Plan the move carefully, don't be reckless

DOMAIN 2: PHYSICS  
Pattern: "Objects in motion stay in motion; objects at rest stay at rest"
Application: Career momentum matters; staying still gets harder, moving is hard to stop
Insight: Once you're moving, momentum carries you; making the first move is hardest
→ Application: If you're going to move, do it; don't keep reconsidering

DOMAIN 3: PSYCHOLOGY
Pattern: "Humans crave meaning and mastery more than security"
Application: Even if new career pays less, if it's meaningful, satisfaction might be higher
Insight: Don't optimize purely for money; meaning matters
→ Application: Money is important but not everything

DOMAIN 4: ECONOMICS
Pattern: "Sunk costs are irrelevant to future decisions"
Application: Years spent in current career shouldn't dictate future choices
Insight: "I've invested 10 years" is irrelevant; what matters is next 10 years
→ Application: Don't stay because of past investment; decide on future value

DOMAIN 5: HISTORY
Pattern: "Career changes are most successful when industry is shifting"
Application: If your current industry is declining but new industry is growing, timing is good
Insight: Ride trends, don't fight them
→ Application: Is this about escaping decline or joining growth?

DOMAIN 6: PHILOSOPHY
Pattern: "Authenticity requires alignment between values and actions"
Application: If your current job conflicts with your values, misalignment increases
Insight: Continued misalignment erodes meaning and satisfaction
→ Application: Are you staying inauthentic or moving toward authenticity?

DOMAIN 7: GAME THEORY
Pattern: "First-mover advantage in emerging fields"
Application: New fields reward people who arrive early
Insight: If changing to emerging field, being early is valuable
→ Application: Timing advantage might justify the move

DOMAIN 8: ART
Pattern: "Authenticity emerges through experimentation"
Application: You don't know your best work until you try different things
Insight: Career experimentation is how you discover yourself
→ Application: See career change as exploration, not final commitment
```

## Integration Patterns

### Domains That Reinforce Each Other
```
Psychology + Philosophy:
- Both say: Authenticity and meaning matter
→ STRONG signal: Career change toward authenticity is positive

Biology + Economics:
- Both say: Adaptation is resource-intensive
→ STRONG signal: Career change requires real commitment and reserves
```

### Domains That Conflict
```
Economics + Psychology:
- Economics says: Optimize for money
- Psychology says: Optimize for meaning
→ TENSION: Real tradeoff exists; must choose based on values
```

### Novel Combinations
```
History + Game Theory:
- History: Recessions force career changes
- Game Theory: Scarcity creates competition
→ NEW INSIGHT: In recessions, career change is harder but more valuable if successful
```

## Tips for Strong Multisource Analysis

1. **Don't force it**: Only use domains where patterns actually apply
2. **Go deep**: Extract actual principles, not surface resemblances
3. **Look for contradictions**: Interesting insights come from conflicts
4. **Surprise yourself**: If all domains say the same thing, dig deeper
5. **Connect combinations**: The best insights come from domain intersections
6. **Note irrelevance**: Some domains won't apply; acknowledge that
