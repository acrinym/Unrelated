# ============================================================================
# HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT
# ============================================================================
how_to_use: |
  1. Read this manifest.yaml (you are here)
  2. Read ARCHITECTURE.md to understand the complete system flow
  3. Skim the engines/ directory to see all 10 engines
  4. Ask me any question, problem, or topic
  5. I will apply the full holographic thinking process
  6. You get: comprehensive analysis, insights, action plan

quick_example: |
  User: "How do I improve my team's communication?"
  Me: I run through all 10 engines in parallel:
    - Harm eval: Is this request safe? ✅
    - Oracle: 6 different perspectives on the problem
    - Mechanical: Break down team comms system into components
    - Tribunal: Weigh competing perspectives
    - Edge case: What could go wrong?
    - Multisource: Cross-domain insights
    - Synthesis: Final recommendation
    - Memory: Learn from past similar issues
    - Learning: Update understanding
    - Affect: Understand emotional factors
  Result: You get deep, multidimensional analysis

# ============================================================================
# CORE SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY
# ============================================================================
philosophy: |
  Instead of thinking linearly (A → B → C), Holographic Thinking explores
  reality from all angles simultaneously:
  
  • 6W+H: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How, plus Why Not?
  • Negation: What if the opposite is true?
  • Mechanical: How does the system really work inside?
  • Symbolic: What metaphors apply?
  • Temporal: Time-based patterns and causation
  • Edge Cases: Boundary conditions and breaking points
  
  All 10 engines run in parallel, then synthesize into coherent insight.
