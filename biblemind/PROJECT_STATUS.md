## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. Core Reasoning Engine (`@biblemind/engines`)

**Status:** ✅ Complete (10/10 engines implemented)

All 10 engines are fully implemented and tested:

| Engine | Name | Status | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| **0** | Biblical Wisdom Filter | ✅ | Safety check with veto power |
| **1** | Biblical Oracle | ✅ | 7 theological perspectives |
| **2** | Covenant Analysis | ✅ | 6 biblical covenants |
| **3** | Theological Council | ✅ | 6 voices from traditions |
| **4** | Pastoral Risk Analysis | ✅ | Distress detection & comfort |
| **5** | Cross-Testament Integration | ✅ | OT + NT unified wisdom |
| **6** | Integrated Discernment Synthesis | ✅ | Final answer synthesis |
| **7** | Scripture Memory | ✅ | User history & patterns |
| **8** | Discipleship Tracking | ✅ | Spiritual growth metrics |
| **9** | Heart Condition Analysis | ✅ | Emotional/spiritual state |

**Location:** `/biblemind/packages/engines/`

**Key Files:**
- `src/engines/engine0-wisdom-filter.ts` through `engine9-heart-condition.ts`
- `src/orchestrator.ts` - Coordinates all engines
- `src/types.ts` - Complete TypeScript definitions
- `src/branding.ts` - Public vs internal naming system

**Features:**
- Parallel execution where possible (Phases 2 & 3)
- Sequential execution where necessary (safety → affect → synthesis)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type-safe TypeScript throughout
- Biblical foundation for each engine
- Confidence scoring for all outputs

## 🎓 Biblical Foundation

Each component is grounded in Scripture:

- **Engine 0 (Wisdom Filter):** Proverbs 9:10 - "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom"
- **Engine 1 (Oracle):** Proverbs 11:14 - "In the multitude of counselors there is safety"
- **Engine 4 (Pastoral Risk):** 1 Peter 5:7 - "Cast all your anxieties on Him"
- **Engine 6 (Synthesis):** John 16:13 - "The Spirit will guide you into all truth"
- **Engine 9 (Heart Condition):** 1 Samuel 16:7 - "The LORD looks at the heart"

## 📝 Notes

### Branding Strategy
- **Internal names** (e.g., "Holy Spirit Synthesis") are theologically accurate
- **Public labels** (e.g., "Integrated Discernment Synthesis") reduce friction
- Same code, same function, different presentation based on context
- Configured in `packages/engines/src/branding.ts`

### Theological Approach
- Torah/Bible/Tanakh as primary source
- Church Fathers for historical context
- Multiple denominational perspectives (Orthodox, Catholic, Reformed, Pentecostal, Eastern Orthodox, Messianic)
- Christ-centered hermeneutic
- Emphasis on spiritual formation and discipleship

### Technical Decisions
- **Why TypeScript?** Type safety prevents bugs in complex multi-engine system
- **Why Firebase?** Proven auth + database with generous free tier
- **Why Turborepo?** Shared code between web, mobile, API
- **Why GPT-4?** Superior theological reasoning vs other models
