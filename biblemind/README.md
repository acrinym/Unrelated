# BibleMind: Biblical Holographic Reasoning Engine

**Multi-perspective theological analysis grounded in Scripture**

---

## 🎯 What Is BibleMind?

BibleMind is an AI-powered biblical reasoning platform that provides comprehensive theological analysis using a unique 10-engine holographic thinking methodology. Instead of giving you a single answer, it explores your question from multiple perspectives simultaneously—Torah, Prophets, Gospels, Church tradition, and more—then synthesizes everything into unified, Scripture-grounded wisdom.

### Key Features

- ✅ **10 Parallel Reasoning Engines** - Explore questions from all angles simultaneously
- ✅ **Scripture-Grounded** - Every insight backed by specific Bible passages
- ✅ **Multi-Tradition Wisdom** - Learn how Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, and Messianic traditions approach your question
- ✅ **Covenant Analysis** - Understand God's promises and how Christ fulfills them
- ✅ **Pastoral Care** - Identifies spiritual/emotional distress and provides biblical comfort
- ✅ **Cross-Testament Integration** - See how Old and New Testaments speak together
- ✅ **Discipleship Tracking** - Remember your spiritual growth over time
- ✅ **Comprehensive Knowledge Graph** - 31K+ verses, cross-references, Church Fathers, systematic theology

## 🏗️ Architecture

BibleMind uses a **holographic reasoning system** where each question is analyzed by 10 specialized engines running in parallel:

```
USER QUESTION
    ↓
[ENGINE 0] Biblical Wisdom Filter
    → Safety check: Is this question appropriate?
    ↓
[ENGINE 9] Heart Condition Analysis
    → Understand emotional/spiritual context
    ↓
[PARALLEL PHASE 1]
    [ENGINE 1] Multi-Perspective Analysis (7 theological angles)
    [ENGINE 2] Covenant Analysis (God's promises)
    [ENGINE 4] Pastoral Risk & Distress Analysis (spiritual comfort)
    ↓
[PARALLEL PHASE 2]
    [ENGINE 3] Theological Council (weighing evidence)
    [ENGINE 5] Cross-Testament Integration (OT + NT)
    ↓
[ENGINE 7] Scripture Memory (your history + patterns)
    ↓
[ENGINE 6] Integrated Discernment Synthesis (final answer)
    ↓
[ENGINE 8] Discipleship Growth Tracking (learn over time)
    ↓
FINAL OUTPUT
    Comprehensive biblical guidance with confidence levels
```

### The 10 Engines

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 9+
- Firebase account
- OpenAI API key
- Pinecone account (for knowledge graph)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd Unrelated/biblemind

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### Quick Start: Run API Server

The API server is fully functional and production-ready:

```bash
# Navigate to API directory
cd apps/api

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key and Firebase credentials

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Test it:**
```bash
# Set your Firebase ID token
export FIREBASE_ID_TOKEN="<your-token>"

# Run test client
npx tsx src/test-client.ts
```

### Quick Start: Use Engines Directly

You can also use the reasoning engines directly in your own code:

```typescript
import { analyzeBiblicalQuestion } from '@biblemind/engines';

const result = await analyzeBiblicalQuestion(
  "How do I forgive someone who hurt me deeply?",
  "user123",
  { openaiApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }
);

console.log(result.synthesis); // Full biblical guidance
console.log(result.confidence); // 0-100 confidence score
console.log(result.scriptures); // All scripture citations
```

See `packages/engines/examples/basic-usage.ts` for complete examples.

## 🎨 Branding Philosophy

**Internal vs. External Naming**

Some engines have different public-facing labels to reduce friction and maintain theological humility:

| Internal Name | Public Label | Reason |
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| "Holy Spirit Synthesis" | "Integrated Discernment Synthesis" | Avoids claiming to BE the Holy Spirit |
| "Spiritual Warfare Check" | "Pastoral Risk & Distress Analysis" | More professional, less charismatic-coded |
| "Council of Voices" | "Theological Council" | More institutional-friendly |

**Why?**
- ✅ **Prudence**: Don't unnecessarily offend potential users
- ✅ **Clarity**: We're not claiming to replace the Holy Spirit
- ✅ **Professionalism**: Language churches/institutions can endorse
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Less denominationally-coded, more universal

**The code stays the same. The function stays the same. Only the label changes.**

This is branding prudence, not theological compromise.

## 🧠 How It Works

### Example: "Should I forgive someone who hurt me?"

**1. Biblical Wisdom Filter (Engine 0)**
- ✅ CLEAR - Question is appropriate and seeks biblical guidance

**2. Heart Condition Analysis (Engine 9)**
- Primary emotion: "hurt seeking justice"
- Urgency: 7/10
- Spiritual state: "wrestling with obedience"
- Priming: Emphasize grace + justice perspectives

**3. Multi-Perspective Analysis (Engine 1)**
- **Torah**: "Eye for eye" vs. "Love your neighbor"
- **Prophetic**: Micah 6:8 - "Do justice, love mercy"
- **Gospel**: Matthew 18:21-22 - "Seventy times seven"
- **Apostolic**: Ephesians 4:32 - "Forgiving as God forgave you"
- **Messianic**: Jesus as ultimate forgiver
- **Wisdom**: Proverbs on letting go of anger
- **Mystical**: Holy Spirit's power to forgive

**4. Covenant Analysis (Engine 2)**
- New Covenant: Forgiven much, forgive much
- God's promise: "I will remember their sins no more"

**5. Pastoral Risk Analysis (Engine 4)**
- Distress factor: Bitterness taking root (Hebrews 12:15)
- God's promise: "Vengeance is mine" (Romans 12:19)
- Discipline: Daily prayer for the person

**6. Cross-Testament Integration (Engine 5)**
- OT: Joseph forgiving his brothers (Genesis 50:20)
- NT: Stephen forgiving his murderers (Acts 7:60)
- Pattern: God brings good from evil

**7. Theological Council (Engine 3)**
- Catholic view: Forgiveness as sacramental grace
- Reformed view: Forgiveness flows from justification
- Pentecostal view: Supernatural empowerment to forgive
- Consensus: All agree forgiveness is commanded

**8. Scripture Memory (Engine 7)**
- Recalls: You asked about anger 2 months ago
- Pattern: Recurring hurt from this relationship

**9. Integrated Discernment Synthesis (Engine 6)**
```markdown
# Should You Forgive?

Yes, and here's how:

**Biblical Answer**: Forgiveness is both commanded and enabled by God's grace.

**Key Insights**:
1. Forgiveness doesn't mean trusting again immediately
2. Forgiveness is a decision, feelings follow later
3. God's forgiveness of you is the power source

**Action Plan**:
1. Pray: "God, I choose to forgive [name] as you forgave me"
2. Release them from debt: Stop rehearsing the offense
3. Bless them: Pray for their good (Matthew 5:44)
4. Set boundaries: Forgiveness ≠ enabling continued harm

**Scripture Foundation**:
- Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 3:13, Matthew 6:14-15

**Confidence**: 92%
```

**10. Discipleship Tracking (Engine 8)**
- Predicted growth: This is a pivotal spiritual maturity moment
- Follow-up: Check in after 30 days
